QoL mod which for the time being just adds scrollbars to both buffs' bar UIs in the game.
Should be compatible with any mod which doesn't replace vanilla UI behaviour as well.

The source code for this mod can be found on my GitHub profile: UnknownDevices.
Original image used for the icon of this mod can be found on @BirdSteely's account on Twitter.

Any bug report, feedback, or suggestion is greatly appreciated.
