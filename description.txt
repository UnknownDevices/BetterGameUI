[ENG] QoL mod which enhances many in-game UIs without changing them drastically.
Do note that most features of this mod can be toggled and tweaked from the configs page.

--- Features ---
- Limit the screen space buff lists can take by making them scrollable if they grow too big
- Have the hotbar, fullscreen map, and recipe list be fully interactable while using an item
- Have buff lists no longer cancel your current left click when you hover over them
- Lock the minimap and the buff list under the hotbar when the hotbar is locked
- Include a convenient keybind (N) for locking and unlocking the previously mentioned UIs
- Include toggles for inverting the scroll for various UIs
- Fix various minor visual bugs present in the vanilla game
...And lots of other minor tweaks that you may not even notice

--- Warnings ---
- This mod does not increase the buff slots available to a player, see mods like Fargo's Mutant Mod for this.
- This mod does not work with gamepads at the moment.
