# Better Game UI
A collection of improvements over some in-game UIs

If you encounter an issue, try disabling features until you find the ones giving you trouble, and do consider reporting the issue.

## Features
- Add a scrollbar to the buffs bars and NPC house icons.
- Improve the accessory slots scrollbar.
- Have the hotbar, full-screen  map, and recipe list remain responsive while an item is being used.
- Have dragging a click over a buff icon no longer interrupt the click.
- Have the mouse wheel buttons also scroll the recipe list.
- Invert the mouse scroll for the recipe list, which scrolled opposite to most other UIs.
- Make locking the hotbar also lock all the other off-inventory UIs.
- Add a keybind (N) for quickly toggling locking the previous UIs.
- Fix some minor visual bugs and inconsistencies from the vanilla game.

## Notes
- This mod is not tested for gamepad support.
