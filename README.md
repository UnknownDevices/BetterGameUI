# Better Game UI
A collection of improvements over some in-game UIs

Every feature of this mod is individually toggable for your convenience

## Notable Features
- Equip the buff list with a scrollbar similar to the one provided for the accessory slots
- Replace the accessory slots' scrollbar for an improved one provided by this mod
- Have the hotbar, recipe list, and full-screen map remain interactive while an item is being used
- Have the recipe list be scrollable with the X buttons of the mouse, similar to how the hotbar is
- Have dragging a click over a buff icon no longer interrupt the click
- Lock the minimap and the buff list under the hotbar when the hotbar is locked
- Include a convenient keybind (N) for locking and unlocking the previously mentioned UIs
- Fix a couple of minor visual bugs present in the vanilla game

## Notes
- This mod does not increase the buff slots available to a player, which means that you will not see the scrollbar for the buff list unless you have another mod that increases so
